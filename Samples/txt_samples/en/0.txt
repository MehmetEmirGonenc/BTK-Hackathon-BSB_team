A program should give correct results, but along with that it should also run efficiently. 
A program is said to be efficient when it executes in minimum time and with minimum memory space. 
In order to write efficient programs we need to apply certain data management concepts. 
Data structure is a crucial part of data management. 
A data structure is basically a group of data elements that are put together under one name, and which defines a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.
